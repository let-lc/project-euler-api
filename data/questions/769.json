For example:<br />\n$17^2=f(1,9)$<br />\n$87^2=f(13,40) = f(46,19)$</p>\n\n<p>Define $C(N)$ as the total number of primitive representations of $z^2$ for $0 &lt; z \\leq N$.<br /> \nMultiple representations are counted separately, so for example $z=87$ is counted twice.</p>\n\n<p>You are given $C(10^3)=142$ and $C(10^{6})=142463$ </p>\n\n<p>Find $C(10^{14})$.</p>\n\n"

Hence there are (N+1) x (N+1) rectangular cells.</li><li>The equations of the two outer vertical gridlines are x = -1 and x = 1.</li><li>The equations of the two outer horizontal gridlines are y = -1 and y = 1.</li><li>The grid cells are colored red if they overlap with the <dfn title=\"The unit circle is the circle that has radius 1 and is centered at the origin\">unit circle</dfn>, black otherwise.</li></ul>For this problem we would like you to find the positions of the remaining N inner horizontal and N inner vertical gridlines so that the area occupied by the red cells is minimized.\n\n<p>\nE.g. here is a picture of the solution for N = 10:\n</p><p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p392_gridlines.png\" alt=\"p392_gridlines.png\" /></p>\n\n\nThe area occupied by the red cells for N = 10 rounded to 10 digits behind the decimal point is 3.3469640797.\n\n<p>\nFind the positions for N = 400.<br /> \nGive as your answer the area occupied by the red cells rounded to 10 digits behind the decimal point.\n</p>\n\n"

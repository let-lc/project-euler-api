  "content": "<p>Consider the sequence of real numbers $a_n$ defined by the starting value $a_0$ and the recurrence\n$\\displaystyle a_{n+1}=a_n-\\frac 1 {a_n}$ for any $n  \\ge 0$.</p>\n<p>\nFor some starting values $a_0$ the sequence will be periodic. For example, $a_0=\\sqrt{\\frac 1 2}$ yields the sequence:\n$\\sqrt{\\frac 1 2},-\\sqrt{\\frac 1 2},\\sqrt{\\frac 1 2}, \\dots$</p>\n<p>\nWe are interested in the range of such a periodic sequence which is the difference between the maximum and minimum of the sequence. For example, the range of the sequence above would be $\\sqrt{\\frac 1 2}-(-\\sqrt{\\frac 1 2})=\\sqrt{ 2}$.</p>\n<p>\nLet $S(P)$ be the sum of the ranges of all such periodic sequences with a period not exceeding $P$.<br />\nFor example, $S(2)=2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 2.8284$, being the sum of the ranges of the two sequences starting with $a_0=\\sqrt{\\frac 1 2}$ and $a_0=-\\sqrt{\\frac 1 2}$. <br />\nYou are given $S(3) \\approx 14.6461$ and $S(5) \\approx 124.1056$.\n</p><p>\nFind $S(25)$, rounded to 4 decimal places.</p>\n"

  "content": "<p>A <i>positive integer matrix</i> is a matrix whose elements are all positive integers.<br />\nSome positive integer matrices can be expressed as a square of a positive integer matrix in two different ways. Here is an example:</p>\n\n$$\\begin{pmatrix}\n40 &amp; 12\\\\\n48 &amp; 40\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 &amp; 3\\\\\n12 &amp; 2\n\\end{pmatrix}^2 =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n6 &amp; 1\\\\\n4 &amp; 6\n\\end{pmatrix}^2\n$$\n\n<p>\nWe define F(<var>N</var>) as the number of the 2x2 positive integer matrices which have a <dfn title=\"the sum of the elements on the main diagonal\">trace</dfn> less than <var>N</var> and which can be expressed as a square of a positive integer matrix in two different ways.<br />\nWe can verify that F(50) = 7 and F(1000) = 1019.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFind F(10<sup>7</sup>).\n</p>\n"

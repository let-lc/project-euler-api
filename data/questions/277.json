  "content": "<p>\nA modified Collatz sequence of integers is obtained from a starting value $a_1$ in the following way:</p>\n<p>\n$a_{n+1} = \\, \\,\\, \\frac {a_n} 3 \\quad$ if $a_n$ is divisible by $3$. We shall denote this as a large downward step, \"D\".</p>\n<p>\n$a_{n+1} = \\frac {4 a_n+2} 3 \\, \\,$ if $a_n$ divided by $3$ gives a remainder of $1$. We shall denote this as an upward step, \"U\".\n</p>\n<p>\n$a_{n+1} = \\frac {2 a_n -1} 3 \\, \\,$ if $a_n$ divided by $3$ gives a remainder of $2$. We shall denote this as a small downward step, \"d\".\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\nThe sequence terminates when some $a_n = 1$.\n</p>\n<p>\nGiven any integer, we can list out the sequence of steps.<br />\nFor instance if $a_1=231$, then the sequence $\\{a_n\\}=\\{231,77,51,17,11,7,10,14,9,3,1\\}$ corresponds to the steps \"DdDddUUdDD\".\n</p>\n<p>\nOf course, there are other sequences that begin with that same sequence \"DdDddUUdDD....\".<br />\nFor instance, if $a_1=1004064$, then the sequence is DdDddUUdDDDdUDUUUdDdUUDDDUdDD.<br />\nIn fact, $1004064$ is the smallest possible $a_1 &gt; 10^6$ that begins with the sequence DdDddUUdDD.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhat is the smallest $a_1 &gt; 10^{15}$ that begins with the sequence \"UDDDUdddDDUDDddDdDddDDUDDdUUDd\"?\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

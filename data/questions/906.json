They choose option $i$ if at least two of the three friends prefer $i$ over $j$ for every alternative option $j$. If no such option $i$ exists they fail to reach an agreement.\n</p>\n<p>\nDefine $P(n)$ to be the probability the three friends successfully reach an agreement and choose one option, where each of the friends' individual order of preference is given by a (possibly different) random permutation of $1,\\dots,n$.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou are given $P(3)=17/18$ and $P(10)\\approx0.6760292265$.\n</p>\n<p>\nFind $P(20\\,000)$.

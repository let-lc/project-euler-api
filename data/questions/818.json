  "content": "<p>\nThe SETÂ® card game is played with a pack of $81$ distinct cards. Each card has four features (Shape, Color, Number, Shading). Each feature has three different variants (e.g. Color can be red, purple, green).</p>\n\n<p>\nA <i>SET</i> consists of three different cards such that each feature is either the same on each card or different on each card.</p>\n\n<p>\nFor a collection $C_n$ of $n$ cards, let $S(C_n)$ denote the number of <i>SET</i>s in $C_n$. Then define $F(n) = \\sum\\limits_{C_n} S(C_n)^4$ where $C_n$ ranges through all collections of $n$ cards (among the $81$ cards).\nYou are given $F(3) = 1080$ and $F(6) = 159690960$.</p>\n\n<p>\nFind $F(12)$.</p>\n\n<p>\n$\\scriptsize{\\text{SET is a registered trademark of Cannei, LLC.

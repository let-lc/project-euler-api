There is an unlimited number of tiles available in each combination of size and colour.</p>\n\n<p>These are used to tile a $2\\times n$ rectangle, where $n$ is a positive integer, subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<ul><li>The rectangle must be fully covered by non-overlapping tiles.</li>\n<li>It is <i>not</i> permitted for four tiles to have their corners meeting at a single point.</li>\n<li>Adjacent tiles must be of different colours.</li>\n</ul><p>For example, the following is an acceptable tiling of a $2\\times 12$ rectangle:</p>\n\n<div class=\"center\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p670_strip_acceptable.png\" alt=\"Acceptable colouring\" /></div>\n\n<p>but the following is not an acceptable tiling, because it violates the \"no four corners meeting at a point\" rule:</p>\n\n<div class=\"center\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p670_strip_unacceptable.png\" alt=\"Unacceptable colouring\" /></div>\n\n<p>Let $F(n)$ be the number of ways the $2\\times n$ rectangle can be tiled subject to these rules. Where reflecting horizontally or vertically would give a different tiling, these tilings are to be counted separately.</p>\n\n<p>For example, $F(2) = 120$, $F(5) = 45876$, and $F(100)\\equiv 53275818 \\pmod{1\\,000\\,004\\,321}$.</p>\n<p>Find $F(10^{16}) \\bmod 1\\,000\\,004\\,321$.</p>\n\n\n"

There is no descending subsequence with more than two elements.\n</p>\n\n<p>Note that subsequences need not be contiguous. For example, the permutation $(4,1,3,2)$ is not counted because it has a descending subsequence of three elements: $(4,3,2)$. You are given $P(2)=13$ and $P(10) \\equiv 45265702 \\pmod{10^9 + 7}$.</p>\n\n<p>Find $P(10^8)$ and give your answer modulo $10^9 + 7$.</p>\n\n"

  "content": "<p>\nAnton and Bertrand love to play three pile Nim.<br />\nHowever, after a lot of games of Nim they got bored and changed the rules somewhat.<br />\nThey may only take a number of stones from a pile that is a <dfn title=\"a proper divisor of n is a divisor of n smaller than n\">proper divisor</dfn> of the number of stones present in the pile.<br /> E.g. if a pile at a certain moment contains 24 stones they may take only 1,2,3,4,6,8 or 12 stones from that pile.<br />\nSo if a pile contains one stone they can't take the last stone from it as 1 isn't a proper divisor of 1.<br />\nThe first player that can't make a valid move loses the game.<br />\nOf course both Anton and Bertrand play optimally.</p>\n<p>\nThe triple (<var>a</var>,<var>b</var>,<var>c</var>) indicates the number of stones in the three piles.<br />\nLet <var>S</var>(<var>n</var>) be the number of winning positions for the next player for 1 ≤ <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var> ≤ <var>n</var>.<br /><var>S</var>(10) = 692 and <var>S</var>(100) = 735494.</p>\n<p>\nFind <var>S</var>(123456787654321) modulo 1234567890.\n</p>\n"

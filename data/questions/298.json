Each player can remember up to 5 previous numbers. When the called number is in a player's memory, that player is awarded a point. If it's not, the player adds the called number to his memory, removing another number if his memory is full.</p>\n\n<p>Both players start with empty memories. Both players always add new missed numbers to their memory but use a different strategy in deciding which number to remove:<br />\nLarry's strategy is to remove the number that hasn't been called in the longest time.<br />\nRobin's strategy is to remove the number that's been in the memory the longest time.</p>\n\n<p>Example game:</p>\n<table class=\"grid center\"><tr><th>Turn</th>\n  <th>Called<br />number</th>\n  <th class=\"right\">Larry's<br />memory</th>\n  <th>Larry's<br />score</th>\n  <th class=\"right\">Robin's<br />memory</th>\n  <th>Robin's<br />score</th>\n</tr><tr><td>1</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">1</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">1</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n</tr><tr><td>2</td>\n  <td>2</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">1,2</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">1,2</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n</tr><tr><td>3</td>\n  <td>4</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">1,2,4</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">1,2,4</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n</tr><tr><td>4</td>\n  <td>6</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">1,2,4,6</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">1,2,4,6</td>\n  <td>0</td>\n</tr><tr><td>5</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">1,2,4,6</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">1,2,4,6</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n</tr><tr><td>6</td>\n  <td>8</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">1,2,4,6,8</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">1,2,4,6,8</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n</tr><tr><td>7</td>\n  <td>10</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">1,4,6,8,10</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">2,4,6,8,10</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n</tr><tr><td>8</td>\n  <td>2</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">1,2,6,8,10</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">2,4,6,8,10</td>\n  <td>2</td>\n</tr><tr><td>9</td>\n  <td>4</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">1,2,4,8,10</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">2,4,6,8,10</td>\n  <td>3</td>\n</tr><tr><td>10</td>\n  <td>1</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">1,2,4,8,10</td>\n  <td>2</td>\n  <td class=\"right\">1,4,6,8,10</td>\n  <td>3</td>\n</tr></table><p>Denoting Larry's score by <var>L</var> and Robin's score by <var>R</var>, what is the expected value of |<var>L</var>-<var>R</var>| after 50 turns?

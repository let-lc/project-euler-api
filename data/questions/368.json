  "content": "<p>The <b> harmonic series </b> $1 + \\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{1}{3} + \\dfrac{1}{4} + ...$ is well known to be divergent.</p>\n\n<p>If we however omit from this series every term where the denominator has a 9 in it, the series remarkably enough converges to approximately 22.9206766193.<br />\nThis modified harmonic series is called the <b>Kempner</b> series.</p>\n\n<p>Let us now consider another modified harmonic series by omitting from the harmonic series every term where the denominator has 3 or more equal consecutive digits.\nOne can verify that out of the first 1200 terms of the harmonic series, only 20 terms will be omitted.<br />\nThese 20 omitted terms are:</p>\n<p>$$\\dfrac{1}{111}, \\dfrac{1}{222}, \\dfrac{1}{333}, \\dfrac{1}{444}, \\dfrac{1}{555}, \\dfrac{1}{666}, \\dfrac{1}{777}, \\dfrac{1}{888}, \\dfrac{1}{999}, \\dfrac{1}{1000}, \\dfrac{1}{1110},$$\n$$\\dfrac{1}{1111}, \\dfrac{1}{1112}, \\dfrac{1}{1113}, \\dfrac{1}{1114}, \\dfrac{1}{1115}, \\dfrac{1}{1116}, \\dfrac{1}{1117}, \\dfrac{1}{1118}, \\dfrac{1}{1119}$$</p>\n\n<p>This series converges as well.</p>\n\n<p>Find the value the series converges to.<br />\nGive your answer rounded to 10 digits behind the decimal point.</p>\n"

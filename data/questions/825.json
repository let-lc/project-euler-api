  "content": "<p>Two cars are on a circular track of total length $2n$, facing the same direction, initially distance $n$ apart.<br />\nThey move in turn. At each turn, the moving car will advance a distance of $1$, $2$ or $3$, with equal probabilities.<br />\nThe chase ends when the moving car reaches or goes beyond the position of the other car. The moving car is declared the winner.</p>\n\n<p>Let $S(n)$ be the difference between the winning probabilities of the two cars.<br />\nFor example, when $n = 2$, the winning probabilities of the two cars are $\\frac 9 {11}$ and $\\frac 2 {11}$, and thus $S(2) = \\frac 7 {11}$.</p>\n\n<p>Let $\\displaystyle T(N) = \\sum_{n = 2}^N S(n)$.</p>\n\n<p>You are given that $T(10) = 2.38235282$ rounded to 8 digits after the decimal point.</p>\n\n<p>Find $T(10^{14})$, rounded to 8 digits after the decimal point.</p>\n"

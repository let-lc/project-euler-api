It can also be shown that this is the lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved. \nSo, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for the given values of <var>n</var>, <var>a</var>, and <var>b</var>.</p>\n\n<p>Let $C(n, a, b)$ be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for the given values of <var>n</var>, <var>a</var> and <var>b</var>.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few examples:<br />\n$C(5, 2, 3) = 5$<br />\n$C(500, \\sqrt 2, \\sqrt 3) = 13.22073197\\dots$<br />\n$C(20000, 5, 7) = 82$<br />\n$C(2000000, \\sqrt 5, \\sqrt 7) = 49.63755955\\dots$</p>\n\n<p>Let $F_k$ be the Fibonacci numbers: $F_k=F_{k-1}+F_{k-2}$ with base cases $F_1=F_2= 1$.<br />Find $\\displaystyle \\sum \\limits_{k = 1}^{30} {C \\left (10^{12}, \\sqrt{k}, \\sqrt{F_k} \\right )}$, and give your answer rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.</p>\n"

  "content": "<p>\nTom (the cat) and Jerry (the mouse) are playing on a simple graph $G$.\n</p>\n<p>\nEvery vertex of $G$ is a mousehole, and every edge of $G$ is a tunnel connecting two mouseholes.\n</p>\n<p>\nOriginally, Jerry is hiding in one of the mouseholes.<br />\nEvery morning, Tom can check one (and only one) of the mouseholes. If Jerry happens to be hiding there then Tom catches Jerry and the game is over.<br />\nEvery evening, if the game continues, Jerry moves to a mousehole which is adjacent (i.e. connected by a tunnel, if there is one available) to his current hiding place. The next morning Tom checks again and the game continues like this.\n</p>\n<p>\nLet us call a graph $G$ a <i>Tom graph</i>, if our super-smart Tom, who knows the configuration of the graph but does not know the location of Jerry, can <i>guarantee</i> to catch Jerry in finitely many days.\nFor example consider all graphs on 3 nodes:\n</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p690_graphs.jpg\" alt=\"Graphs on 3 nodes\" /></div>\n<p>\nFor graphs 1 and 2, Tom will catch Jerry in at most three days. For graph 3 Tom can check the middle connection on two consecutive days and hence guarantee to catch Jerry in at most two days. These three graphs are therefore Tom Graphs. However, graph 4 is not a Tom Graph because the game could potentially continue forever.\n</p>\n<p>\nLet $T(n)$ be the number of different Tom graphs with $n$ vertices. Two graphs are considered the same if there is a bijection $f$ between their vertices, such that $(v,w)$ is an edge if and only if $(f(v),f(w))$ is an edge.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe have $T(3) = 3$, $T(7) = 37$, $T(10) = 328$ and $T(20) = 1416269$.\n</p>\n<p>\nFind $T(2019)$ giving your answer modulo $1\\,000\\,000\\,007$.\n</p>\n"

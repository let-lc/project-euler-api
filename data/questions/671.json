  "content": "<p>A certain type of flexible tile comes in three different sizes - 1×1, 1×2, and 1×3 - and in $k$ different colours. There is an unlimited number of tiles available in each combination of size and colour.</p>\n\n<p>These are used to tile a closed loop of width $2$ and length (circumference) $n$, where $n$ is a positive integer, subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<ul><li>The loop must be fully covered by non-overlapping tiles.</li>\n<li>It is <i>not</i> permitted for four tiles to have their corners meeting at a single point.</li>\n<li>Adjacent tiles must be of different colours.</li>\n</ul><p>For example, the following is an acceptable tiling of a $2\\times 23$ loop with $k=4$ (blue, green, red and yellow):</p>\n\n<div class=\"center\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p671_loop_acceptable.png\" alt=\"Acceptable colouring\" /></div>\n\n<p>but the following is not an acceptable tiling, because it violates the \"no four corners meeting at a point\" rule:</p>\n\n<div class=\"center\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p671_loop_unacceptable.png\" alt=\"Unacceptable colouring\" /></div>\n\n<p>Let $F_k(n)$ be the number of ways the $2\\times n$ loop can be tiled subject to these rules when $k$ colours are available. (Not all $k$ colours have to be used.) Where reflecting horizontally or vertically would give a different tiling, these tilings are to be counted separately.</p>\n\n<p>For example, $F_4(3) = 104$, $F_5(7) = 3327300$, and $F_6(101)\\equiv 75309980 \\pmod{1\\,000\\,004\\,321}$.</p>\n<p>Find $F_{10}(10\\,004\\,003\\,002\\,001) \\bmod 1\\,000\\,004\\,321$.</p>\n\n"

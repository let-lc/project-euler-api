There are exactly seventeen ways of doing this.</p>\n\n<div class=\"center\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p114.png\" alt=\"p114.png\" /></div>\n\n<p>How many ways can a row measuring fifty units in length be filled?</p>\n<p class=\"note\">NOTE: Although the example above does not lend itself to the possibility, in general it is permitted to mix block sizes. For example, on a row measuring eight units in length you could use red (3), grey (1), and red (4).</p>\n"

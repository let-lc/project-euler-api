The $n$-th troll is characterized by:\n</p>\n<ul><li>the distance from his feet to his shoulders in cm, $h_n$</li>\n<li>the length of his arms in cm, $l_n$</li>\n<li>his IQ (Irascibility Quotient), $q_n$.</li>\n</ul><p>\nTrolls can pile up on top of each other, with each troll standing on the shoulders of the one below him. A troll can climb out of the hole and escape if his hands can reach to the surface. Once a troll escapes he cannot participate any further in the escaping effort.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe trolls execute an optimal strategy for maximizing the total IQ of the escaping trolls, defined as $Q(N)$.\n</p>\n<p>\nLet<br />\n$r_n = \\left[ \\left( 5^n \\bmod (10^9 + 7) \\right) \\bmod 101 \\right] + 50$\n<br />\n$h_n = r_{3n}$\n<br />\n$l_n = r_{3n+1}$\n<br />\n$q_n = r_{3n+2}$\n<br />\n$D_N = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} h_n$.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor example, the first troll ($n=0$) is 51cm tall to his shoulders, has 55cm long arms, and has an IQ of 75.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou are given that $Q(5) = 401$ and $Q(15)=941$.\n</p>\n<p>\nFind $Q(1000)$.</p>\n"

  "content": "<p>\nFor every positive integer $n$ the Fibonacci sequence modulo \n$n$ is periodic. The period depends on the value of $n$.\nThis period is called the <strong>Pisano period</strong> for $n$, often shortened to $\\pi(n)$.</p>\n<p>\nThere are three values of $n$ for which \n$\\pi(n)$ equals $18$: $19$, $38$ and $76$. The sum of those smaller than $50$ is $57$.\n</p>\n<p>\nFind the sum of the values of $n$ smaller than $1\\,000\\,000\\,000$ for which $\\pi(n)$ equals $120$.\n</p>\n"

  "content": "<p>Mamma Triangolo baked a triangular pizza. She wants to cut the pizza into $n$ pieces. She first chooses a point $P$ in the interior (not boundary) of the triangle pizza, and then performs $n$ cuts, which all start from $P$ and extend straight to the boundary of the pizza so that the $n$ pieces are all triangles and all have the same area.</p>\n\n<p>Let $\\psi(n)$ be the number of different ways for Mamma Triangolo to cut the pizza, subject to the constraints.<br />\nFor example, $\\psi(3)=7$.</p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p747_PizzaDiag.jpg\" class=\"dark_img\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n\n<p>Also $\\psi(6)=34$, and $\\psi(10)=90$.</p>\n\n<p>Let $\\Psi(m)=\\displaystyle\\sum_{n=3}^m \\psi(n)$. You are given $\\Psi(10)=345$ and $\\Psi(1000)=172166601$.</p>\n\n<p>Find $\\Psi(10^8)$. Give your answer modulo $1\\,000\\,000\\,007$.</p>\n"

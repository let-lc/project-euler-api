  "content": "<p>\nGary and Sally play a game using gold and silver coins arranged into a number of vertical stacks, alternating turns. On Gary's turn he chooses a gold coin and removes it from the game along with any other coins sitting on top. Sally does the same on her turn by removing a silver coin. The first player unable to make a move loses.</p>\n\n<p>\nAn arrangement is called <dfn>fair</dfn> if the person moving first, whether it be Gary or Sally, will lose the game if both play optimally.</p>\n\n<p>\nAn arrangement is called <dfn>balanced</dfn> if the number of gold and silver coins are equal.</p>\n\n<p>\nDefine $G(m)$ to be the number of fair and balanced arrangements consisting of three non-empty stacks, each not exceeding $m$ in size. Different orderings of the stacks are to be counted separately, so $G(2)=6$ due to the following six arrangements:</p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"resources/images/0895_G2.png?1714251811\" alt=\"0895_G2.png\"></div>\n\n<p>\nYou are also given $G(5)=348$ and $G(20)=125825982708$.</p>\n\n<p>\nFind $G(9898)$ giving your answer modulo $989898989$.</p>\n"

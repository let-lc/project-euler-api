Note that rolling both dice at the same time is still counted as two dice rolls.</p>\n\n<p>There exist other more complex procedures for emulating a 28-sided dice that entail a smaller average number of dice rolls. However, the above procedure has the attractive property that the sequence of dice rolled is predetermined: regardless of the outcome, it follows (D5,D6,D5,D6,D6,D6,D6,...), truncated wherever the process stops. In fact, amongst procedures for $n=28$ with this restriction, this one is optimal in the sense of minimising the expected number of rolls needed.</p>\n\n<p>Different values of $n$ will in general use different predetermined sequences. For example, for $n=8$, the sequence (D5,D5,D5,...) gives an optimal procedure, taking 2.083333... dice rolls on average.</p>\n\n<p>Define $R(n)$ to be the expected number of dice rolls for an optimal procedure for emulating an $n$-sided dice using only a five-sided and a six-sided dice, considering only those procedures where the sequence of dice rolled is predetermined. So, $R(8) \\approx 2.083333$ and $R(28) \\approx 2.142476$.</p>\n\n<p>Let $S(n) = \\displaystyle\\sum_{k=2}^n R(k)$. You are given that $S(30) \\approx 56.054622$.</p>\n\n<p>Find $S(1000)$. Give your answer rounded to 6 decimal places.</p>\n\n"

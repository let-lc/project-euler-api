For $n=4$ the stack looks like the picture below.\n</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p726_FallingBottles.jpg\" class=\"dark_img\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p>\nThe <i>collapsing process</i> happens every time a bottle is taken. A space is created in the stack and that space is filled according to the following recursive steps:\n</p><ul><li>No bottle touching from above: nothing happens. For example, taking $F$.</li>\n<li>One bottle touching from above: that will drop down to fill the space creating another space. For example, taking $D$.</li>\n<li>Two bottles touching from above: one will drop down to fill the space creating another space. For example, taking $C$.</li>\n</ul><p>\nThis process happens recursively; for example, taking bottle $A$ in the diagram above. Its place can be filled with either $B$ or $C$. If it is filled with $C$ then the space that $C$ creates can be filled with $D$ or $E$. So there are 3 different collapsing processes that can happen if $A$ is taken, although the final shape (in this case) is the same.\n</p>\n<p>\nDefine $f(n)$ to be the number of ways that we can take all the bottles from a stack with $n$ layers. \nTwo ways are considered different if at any step we took a different bottle or the collapsing process went differently.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou are given $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 6$ and $f(3) = 1008$.\n</p>\nAlso define\n<div class=\"center\">\n$\\displaystyle\tS(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^n f(k)$</div>\n<p>\nFind $S(10^4)$ and give your answer modulo $1\\,000\\,000\\,033$.\n</p>\n"

Let $\\pi = 3.14159\\cdots\\ $.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the function $f$ from $\\Bbb R^2$ to $\\Bbb R^2$ defined by $f(x, y) = (x^2 - x - y^2, 2xy - y + \\pi)$, and its $n$-th iterated composition $f^{(n)}(x, y) = f(f(\\cdots f(x, y)\\cdots))$. For example $f^{(3)}(x, y) = f(f(f(x, y)))$. A pair $(x, y)$ is said to have period $n$ if $n$ is the smallest positive integer such that $f^{(n)}(x, y) = (x, y)$.</p>\n\n<p>Let $P(n)$ denote the sum of $x$-coordinates of all points having period not exceeding $n$.\nInterestingly, $P(n)$ is always an integer. For example, $P(1) = 2$, $P(2) = 2$, $P(3) = 4$.</p>\n\n<p>Find $P(10^7)$ and give your answer modulo $1\\,020\\,340\\,567$.</p>\n"

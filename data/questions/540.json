  "content": "<p>\nA <b>Pythagorean triple</b> consists of three positive integers $a, b$ and $c$ satisfying $a^2+b^2=c^2$.<br />\nThe triple is called primitive if $a, b$ and $c$ are relatively prime.<br />\nLet P($n$) be the number of <b>primitive Pythagorean triples</b> with $a &lt; b &lt; c \\le n$.<br />\nFor example P(20) = 3, since there are three triples: (3,4,5), (5,12,13) and (8,15,17).\n</p>\n<p>\nYou are given that P(10<sup>6</sup>) = 159139.<br />\nFind P(3141592653589793).\n</p>\n"

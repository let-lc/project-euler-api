  "content": "<p>\nGiven a set, $L$, of unique lines, let $M(L)$ be the number of lines in the set and let $S(L)$ be the sum over every line of the number of times that line is crossed by another line in the set.  For example, two sets of three lines are shown below:\n</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"project/images/p630_threelines.png\" alt=\"crossed lines\" /></div>\n<p>\nIn both cases M(L) is 3 and S(L) is 6: each of the three lines is crossed by two other lines.  Note that even if the lines cross at a single point, all of the separate crossings of lines are counted.\n</p>\n<p>\nConsider points ($T_{2k−1}$, $T_{2k}$), for integer $k &gt;= 1$, generated in the following way:\n</p>\n<p>\n$S_0 \t=  \t290797$<br /> \n$S_{n+1} \t=  \t{S_n}^2 \\:\\: \\rm{mod} \\:\\: 50515093$<br />\n$T_n \t=  \t( S_n \\:\\: \\rm{mod} \\:\\: 2000 ) − 1000$\n</p>\n<p>\nFor example, the first three points are: (527, 144), (−488, 732), (−454, −947).  Given the first $n$ points generated in this manner, let $L_n$ be the set of <b>unique</b> lines that can be formed by joining each point with every other point, the lines being extended indefinitely in both directions.  We can then define $M(L_n)$ and $S(L_n)$ as described above.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor example, $M(L_3) = 3$ and $S(L_3) = 6$.  Also $M(L_{100}) = 4948$ and $S(L_{100}) = 24477690$.\n</p><p>\nFind $S(L_{2500})$.\n</p>\n\n\n"

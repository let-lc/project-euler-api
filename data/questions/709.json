  "content": "<p>Every day for the past $n$ days Even Stevens brings home his groceries in a plastic bag. He stores these plastic bags in a cupboard. He either puts the plastic bag into the cupboard with the rest, or else he takes an <b>even</b> number of the existing bags (which may either be empty or previously filled with other bags themselves) and places these into the current bag.</p>\n\n<p>After 4 days there are 5 possible packings and if the bags are numbered 1 (oldest), 2, 3, 4, they are:</p>\n<ul><li>Four empty bags,</li>\n<li>1 and 2 inside 3, 4 empty,</li>\n<li>1 and 3 inside 4, 2 empty,</li>\n<li>1 and 2 inside 4, 3 empty,</li>\n<li>2 and 3 inside 4, 1 empty.</li>\n</ul><p>Note that 1, 2, 3 inside 4 is invalid because every bag must contain an even number of bags.</p>\n\n<p>Define $f(n)$ to be the number of possible packings of $n$ bags. Hence $f(4)=5$. You are also given $f(8)=1\\,385$.</p>\n\n<p>Find $f(24\\,680)$ giving your answer modulo $1\\,020\\,202\\,009$.</p>\n"

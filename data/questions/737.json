In general, to loop $k$ times, $n$ is the smallest number for which the sum is greater than $360^\\circ k$.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlso, $154$ coins are needed to loop two times around the line, and $6947$ coins to loop ten times.\n</p>\n<p>\nCalculate the number of coins needed to loop $2020$ times around the line.\n</p>\n"

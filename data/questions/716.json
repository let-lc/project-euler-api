Similarly, $H$ horizontal directed lines are drawn and all the edges on these lines inherit that direction.\n</p>\n<p>\nTwo nodes, $A$ and $B$ in a directed graph, are <b>strongly connected</b> if there is both a path, along the directed edges, from $A$ to $B$ as well as from $B$ to $A$. Note that every node is strongly connected to itself.\n</p>\n<p>\nA <b>strongly connected component</b> in a directed graph is a non-empty set $M$ of nodes satisfying the following two properties:\n</p>\n<ul><li>All nodes in $M$ are strongly connected to each other.</li>\n<li>$M$ is maximal, in the sense that no node in $M$ is strongly connected to any node outside of $M$.</li>\n</ul><p>\nThere are $2^H\\times 2^W$ ways of drawing the directed lines. Each way gives a directed graph $\\mathcal{G}$. We define $S(\\mathcal{G})$ to be the number of strongly connected components in $\\mathcal{G}$.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe illustration below shows a directed graph with $H=3$ and $W=4$ that consists of four different strongly connected components (indicated by the different colours).\n</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p716_gridgraphics.jpg\" class=\"dark_img\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<p>\nDefine $C(H,W)$ to be the sum of $S(\\mathcal{G})$ for all possible graphs on a grid of $H\\times W$.

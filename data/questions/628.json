In the following, we consider all positions in which $n$ pawns are placed on a  $n \\times n$  \nboard in such a way, that there is a single pawn in every row and every column.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nWe call such a position an <i>open</i> position, if a rook, starting at the (empty) lower left corner and using only moves towards the right or upwards, can reach the upper right corner without moving onto any field occupied by a pawn. \n</p>\n<p>Let $f(n)$ be the number of open positions for a $n \\times n$ chessboard.<br />\nFor example, $f(3)=2$, illustrated by the two open positions for a $3  \\times 3$ chessboard below.\n\n</p>\n<table align=\"center\"><tr><td><img src=\"project/images/p628_chess4.png\" alt=\"Open position 1\" /></td><td width=\"60\"></td><td><img src=\"project/images/p628_chess5.png\" alt=\"Open position 2\" /></td>\n</tr></table><p>\nYou are also given $f(5)=70$.</p>\n<p>Find $f(10^8)$ modulo $1\\,008\\,691\\,207$.</p>\n\n\n\n\n"

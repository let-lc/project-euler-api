Consider the three rectangles with sides parallel to the sides of the unit square and a diagonal that is one of the three line segments $\\overline{P_1P_2}$, $\\overline{P_1P_3}$ or $\\overline{P_2P_3}$ (see picture below).</p>\n\n<div class=\"center\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p695_randrect.png\" alt=\"3 random rectangles\" /></div>\n\n<p>We are interested in the rectangle with the second biggest area. In the example above that happens to be the green rectangle defined with the diagonal $\\overline{P_2P_3}$.</p>\n\n<p>Find the expected value of the area of the second biggest of the three rectangles. Give your answer rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point.</p>\n"

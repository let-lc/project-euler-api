The following eight moves will finish the game:</p>\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"project/images/p334_beans.gif\" class=\"dark_img\" alt=\"p334_beans.gif\" /></div>\n\n<p>You are given the following sequences:<br /></p>\n\n<p>\n$\\def\\htmltext#1{\\style{font-family:inherit;}{\\text{#1}}}$\n$\n\\begin{align}\n\\qquad t_0 &amp;= 123456,\\cr\n\\qquad t_i &amp;= \\cases{\n\\;\\;\\frac{t_{i-1}}{2},&amp;$\\htmltext{if }t_{i-1}\\htmltext{ is even}$\\cr\n\\left\\lfloor\\frac{t_{i-1}}{2}\\right\\rfloor\\oplus 926252,&amp;$\\htmltext{if }t_{i-1}\\htmltext{ is odd}$\\cr}\\cr\n&amp;\\qquad\\htmltext{where }\\lfloor x\\rfloor\\htmltext{ is the floor function }\\cr\n&amp;\\qquad\\!\\htmltext{and }\\oplus\\htmltext{is the bitwise XOR operator.}\\cr\n\\qquad b_i &amp;= (t_i\\bmod2^{11}) + 1.\\cr\n\\end{align}\n$\n</p>\n\n<p>The first two terms of the last sequence are $b_1 = 289$ and $b_2 = 145$.<br />\nIf we start with $b_1$ and $b_2$ beans in two adjacent bowls, $3419100$ moves would be required to finish the game.</p>\n\n<p>Consider now $1500$ adjacent bowls containing $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_{1500}$ beans respectively, all other bowls being empty.

  "content": "<p>Peter is playing a solitaire game on an infinite checkerboard, each square of which can hold an unlimited number of tokens.</p>\n\n<p>Each move of the game consists of the following steps:</p>\n<ol><li>Choose one token $T$ to move. This may be any token on the board, as long as not all of its four adjacent squares are empty.</li>\n<li>Select and discard one token $D$ from a square adjacent to that of $T$.</li>\n<li>Move $T$ to any one of its four adjacent squares (even if that square is already occupied).</li>\n</ol><div class=\"center\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p664_moves.gif\" alt=\"Allowed moves\" /></div>\n\n<p>The board is marked with a line called the <i>dividing line</i>. Initially, every square to the left of the dividing line contains a token, and every square to the right of the dividing line is empty:</p>\n\n<div class=\"center\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p664_starting_0.png\" alt=\"Initial setup\" /></div>\n\n<p>Peter's goal is to get a token as far as possible to the right in a finite number of moves. However, he quickly finds out that, even with his infinite supply of tokens, he cannot move a token more than four squares beyond the dividing line.</p>\n\n<p>Peter then considers starting configurations with larger supplies of tokens: each square in the $d$th column to the left of the dividing line starts with $d^n$ tokens instead of 1. This is illustrated below for $n=1$:</p>\n\n<div class=\"center\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p664_starting_1.png\" alt=\"Initial setup n=1\" /></div>\n\n<p>Let $F(n)$ be the maximum number of squares Peter can move a token beyond the dividing line. For example, $F(0)=4$.\nYou are also given that $F(1)=6$, $F(2)=9$, $F(3)=13$, $F(11)=58$ and $F(123)=1173$.</p>\n<p>Find $F(1234567)$.</p>\n\n"

A <i>coprime permutation</i> is a rearrangement such that all pairs of adjacent numbers are coprime.</p>\n\n<p>Let $P(n)$ be the number of coprime permutations of $\\{2,3,\\ldots,n\\}$.</p>\n\n<p>For example, $P(4)=2$ as there are two coprime permutations, $(2,3,4)$ and $(4,3,2)$. You are also given $P(10)=576$.</p>\n\n<p>Find $P(34)$ and give your answer modulo $83\\,456\\,729$.</p>\n"

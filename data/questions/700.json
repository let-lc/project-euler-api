The second term is 3008341430083414 which is greater than 1504170715041707 so is not an Eulercoin.  However, the third term is 8912517754604 which is small enough to be a new Eulercoin.</p>\n\n<p>The sum of the first 2 Eulercoins is therefore 1513083232796311.</p>\n\n<p>Find the sum of all Eulercoins.</p>\n\n"

Initially $S$ and $M$ are full and $L$ is empty. If the above rule of pouring still applies and $a$ and $b$ are two coprime positive integers with $a\\leq b$ then it is always possible to measure one litre in finitely many steps.\n</p>\n<p>\nLet $P(a,b)$ be the minimal number of pourings needed to get one litre. Thus $P(3,5)=4$.<br />\nAlso, $P(7, 31)=20$ and $P(1234, 4321)=2780$.\n</p>\n<p>\nFind the sum of $P(2^{p^5}-1, 2^{q^5}-1)$ for all pairs of prime numbers $p,q$ such that $p &lt; q &lt; 1000$.<br />\nGive your answer modulo $1\\,000\\,000\\,007$.\n</p>\n"

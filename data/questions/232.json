If it comes up Heads, then Player 1 scores one point; if it comes up Tails, then no points are scored.</p>\n\n<p>On Player 2's turn, a positive integer, $T$, is chosen by Player 2 and the coin is tossed $T$ times. If it comes up all Heads, then Player 2 scores $2^{T-1}$ points; otherwise, no points are scored.</p>\n\n<p>Player 1 goes first and the winner is the first to 100 or more points.</p>\n\n<p>Player 2 will always selects the number, $T$, of coin tosses that maximises the probability of winning.</p>\n\n<p>What is the probability that Player 2 wins?</p>\n\n<p>Give your answer rounded to eight decimal places in the form $0.abcdefgh$.</p>\n"

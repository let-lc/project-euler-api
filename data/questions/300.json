  "content": "<p>In a very simplified form, we can consider proteins as strings consisting of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) elements, e.g. HHPPHHHPHHPH. <br />\nFor this problem, the orientation of a protein is important; e.g. HPP is considered distinct from PPH. Thus, there are 2<sup><var>n</var></sup> distinct proteins consisting of <var>n</var> elements.</p>\n\n<p>When one encounters these strings in nature, they are always folded in such a way that the number of H-H contact points is as large as possible, since this is energetically advantageous.<br />\nAs a result, the H-elements tend to accumulate in the inner part, with the P-elements on the outside.<br />\nNatural proteins are folded in three dimensions of course, but we will only consider protein folding in <u>two dimensions</u>.</p>\n\n<p>The figure below shows two possible ways that our example protein could be folded (H-H contact points are shown with red dots).</p>\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"project/images/p300_protein.gif\" alt=\"p300_protein.gif\" /></div>\n\n<p>The folding on the left has only six H-H contact points, thus it would never occur naturally.<br />\nOn the other hand, the folding on the right has nine H-H contact points, which is optimal for this string.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming that H and P elements are equally likely to occur in any position along the string, the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding of a random protein string of length 8 turns out to be 850 / 2<sup>8</sup>=3.3203125.</p>\n\n<p>What is the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding of a random protein string of length 15?<br />\nGive your answer using as many decimal places as necessary for an exact result.</p>\n"

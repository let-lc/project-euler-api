The graph can be arranged into levels where vertex $n$ is at level $0$ and vertices that are a distance $k$ from $n$ are on level $k$. Define $g(n)$ to be the maximum number of vertices in a single level. </p>\n\n<img src=\"resources/images/0881_example45.jpg?1707508801\" alt=\"0881_example45.jpg\">\n\n<p>\nThe example above shows that $g(45) = 2$.

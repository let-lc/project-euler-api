For example, for the 2x3 grid graph, there are 19 ways to make the graph rigid:</p>\n<div class=\"center\"><img src=\"project/images/p434_rigid23.png\" class=\"dark_img\" alt=\"p434_rigid23.png\" /></div>\n<p>Note that for the purposes of this problem, we do not consider changing the orientation of a diagonal edge or adding both diagonal edges to a cell as a different way of making a grid graph rigid.\n</p>\n<p>Let <var>R</var>(<var>m</var>,<var>n</var>) be the number of ways to make the <var>m</var> × <var>n</var> grid graph rigid. <br />\nE.g. <var>R</var>(2,3) = 19 and <var>R</var>(5,5) = 23679901\n</p>\n<p>Define <var>S</var>(<var>N</var>) as <span style=\"font-size:larger;\"><span style=\"font-size:larger;\">∑</span></span> <var>R</var>(<var>i</var>,<var>j</var>) for 1 ≤ <var>i</var>, <var>j</var> ≤ <var>N</var>.<br />\nE.g. <var>S</var>(5) = 25021721.<br />\nFind <var>S</var>(100), give your answer modulo 1000000033.\n</p>\n"

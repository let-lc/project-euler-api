  "content": "<p>\nConsider the triangle with sides 6, 8 and 10. It can be seen that the perimeter and the area are both equal to 24. \nSo the area/perimeter ratio is equal to 1.<br />\nConsider also the triangle with sides 13, 14 and 15. The perimeter equals 42 while the area is equal to 84. \nSo for this triangle the area/perimeter ratio is equal to 2.\n</p>\n<p>\nFind the sum of the perimeters of all integer sided triangles for which the area/perimeter ratios are equal to positive integers not exceeding 1000.\n</p>\n\n"

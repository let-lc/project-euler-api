  "content": "<p>\nOdd and Even are playing a game with $N$ cookies.</p>\n\n<p>\nThe game begins with the $N$ cookies divided into one or more piles, not necessarily of the same size. They then make moves in turn, starting with Odd.<br>\nOdd's turn: Odd may choose any pile with an <b>odd</b> number of cookies, eat one and divide the remaining (if any) into two equal piles.<br>\nEven's turn: Even may choose any pile with an <b>even</b> number of cookies, eat two of them and divide the remaining (if any) into two equal piles.<br>\nThe player that does not have a valid move loses the game.</p>\n\n<p>\nLet $C(N)$ be the number of ways that $N$ cookies can be divided so that Even has a winning strategy.<br>\nFor example, $C(5) = 2$ because there are two winning configurations for Even: a single pile containing all five cookies; three piles containing one, two and two cookies.<br>\nYou are also given $C(16) = 64$.</p>\n\n<p>\nFind $C(300)$.</p>\n"

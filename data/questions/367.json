  "content": "<p>\n<b>Bozo sort</b>, not to be confused with the slightly less efficient <b>bogo sort</b>, consists out of checking if the input sequence is sorted and if not swapping randomly two elements. This is repeated until eventually the sequence is sorted.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf we consider all permutations of the first 4 natural numbers as input the expectation value of the number of swaps, averaged over all 4! input sequences is 24.75.<br />\nThe already sorted sequence takes 0 steps. \n</p>\n<p>\nIn this problem we consider the following variant on bozo sort.<br />\nIf the sequence is not in order we pick three elements at random and shuffle these three elements randomly.<br />\nAll 3!=6 permutations of those three elements are equally likely. <br />\nThe already sorted sequence will take 0 steps.<br />\nIf we consider all permutations of the first 4 natural numbers as input the expectation value of the number of shuffles, averaged over all 4! input sequences is 27.5. <br />\nConsider as input sequences the permutations of the first 11 natural numbers.<br />\nAveraged over all 11! input sequences, what is the expected number of shuffles this sorting algorithm will perform?\n</p>\n<p>\nGive your answer rounded to the nearest integer.\n</p>\n"

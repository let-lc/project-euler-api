  "content": "<p>\nTwo players play a game with a single pile of stones of initial size $n$. They take stones from the pile in turn, according to the following rules which depend on a fixed real number $r &gt; 0$:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\nIn the first turn, the first player may take $k$ stones with $1 \\le k \\lt n$.</li>\n<li>\nIf a player takes $m$ stones in a turn, then in the next turn the opponent may take $k$ stones with $1 \\le k \\le \\lfloor r \\cdot m \\rfloor$.</li></ul>\n\n<p>\nWhoever cannot make a legal move loses the game.</p>\n\n<p>\nLet $L(r)$ be the set of initial pile sizes $n$ for which the second player has a winning strategy. For example, $L(0.5) = \\{1\\}$, $L(1) = \\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, \\dots\\}$, $L(2) = \\{1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \\dots\\}$.</p>\n\n<p>\nA real number $q \\gt 0$ is a <i>transition value</i> if $L(s)$ is different from $L(t)$ for all $s &lt; q &lt; t$.<br>\nLet $T(i)$ be the $i$-th transition value. For example, $T(1) = 1$, $T(2) = 2$, $T(22) \\approx 6.3043478261$.</p>\n\n<p>\nFind $T(123456)$ and give your answer rounded to $10$ digits after the decimal point.</p>\n"

MIC-012 and HAN-988 is a win and RYU-500 and SET-500 too (as long as he sees them in the same trip). \n</p><p>\n</p><p>\nFind the expected number of plates he needs to see for a win.<br />\nGive your answer rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.\n</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:88%;\">\n<b>Note:</b> We assume that each licence plate seen is equally likely to have any three digit number on it.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n"

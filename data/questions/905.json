They have been informed beforehand that all three numbers are positive and that one of the numbers is the sum of the other two.</p>\n\n<p>\nOnce in the room, they can see the numbers on each other's hats but not on their own. Starting with A and proceeding cyclically, each epistemologist must either honestly state \"I don't know my number\" or announce \"Now I know my number!\" which terminates the game.</p>\n\n<p>\nFor instance, if their numbers are $A=2, B=1, C=1$ then A declares \"Now I know\" at the first turn. If their numbers are $A=2, B=7, C=5$ then \"I don't know\" is heard four times before B finally declares \"Now I know\" at the fifth turn.</p>\n\n<p>\nLet $F(A,B,C)$ be the number of turns it takes until an epistemologist declares \"Now I know\", including the turn this declaration is made. So $F(2,1,1)=1$ and $F(2,7,5)=5$.</p>\n\n<p>\nFind $\\displaystyle \\sum_{a=1}^7 \\sum_{b=1}^{19} F(a^b, b^a, a^b + b^a)$.</p>\n"

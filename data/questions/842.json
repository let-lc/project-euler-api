Two $n$-star polygons differing by a rotation/reflection are considered <strong>different</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>\nFor example, there are twelve $5$-star polygons shown below.</p>\n<img src=\"resources/images/0842_5-agons.jpg?1680461480\" alt=\"0842_5-agons.jpg\">\n<p>\nFor an $n$-star polygon $S$, let $I(S)$ be the number of its self intersection points.<br>\nLet $T(n)$ be the sum of $I(S)$ over all $n$-star polygons $S$.<br>\nFor the example above $T(5) = 20$ because in total there are $20$ self intersection points.</p>\n\n<p>\nSome star polygons may have intersection points made from more than two lines. These are only counted once. For example, <span style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">$S$,</span> shown below is one of the sixty $6$-star polygons.

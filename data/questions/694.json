  "content": "<p>\nA positive integer $n$ is considered <i>cube-full</i>, if for every prime $p$ that divides $n$, so does $p^3$. Note that $1$ is considered cube-full.\n</p>\n<p>\nLet $s(n)$ be the function that counts the number of cube-full divisors of $n$. For example, $1$, $8$ and $16$ are the three cube-full divisors of $16$. Therefore, $s(16)=3$.\n</p>\n<p>\nLet $S(n)$ represent the summatory function of $s(n)$, that is $S(n)=\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n s(i)$.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou are given $S(16) =  19$, $S(100) = 126$ and $S(10000) = 13344$.\n</p>\n<p>\nFind $S(10^{18})$.\n</p>\n"

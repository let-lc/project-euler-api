  "content": "<p>$n$ families, each with four members, a father, a mother, a son and a daughter, were invited to a restaurant. They were all seated at a large circular table with $4n$ seats such that men and women alternate.</p>\n\n<p>Let $M(n)$ be the number of ways the families can be seated such that none of the families were seated together. A family is considered to be seated together only when all the members of a family sit next to each other.</p>\n\n<p>For example, $M(1)=0$, $M(2)=896$, $M(3)=890880$ and $M(10) \\equiv 170717180 \\pmod {1\\,000\\,000\\,007}$</p>\n\n<p>Let $S(n)=\\displaystyle \\sum_{k=2}^nM(k)$</p>\n\n<p>For example, $S(10) \\equiv 399291975 \\pmod {1\\,000\\,000\\,007}$</p>\n\n<p>Find $S(2021)$. Give your answer modulo $1\\,000\\,000\\,007$.</p>\n\n"

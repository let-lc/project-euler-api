  "content": "<p>A driller drills for water. At each iteration the driller chooses a depth $d$ (a positive real number), drills to this depth and then checks if water was found. If so, the process terminates. Otherwise, a new depth is chosen and a new drilling starts from the ground level in a new location nearby.</p>\n\n<p>Drilling to depth $d$ takes exactly $d$ hours. The groundwater depth is constant in the relevant area and its distribution is known to be an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution\">exponential random variable</a> with expected value of $1$. In other words, the probability that the groundwater is deeper than $d$ is $e^{-d}$.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming an optimal strategy, find the minimal expected drilling time in hours required to find water. Give your answer rounded to 9 places after the decimal point.</p>\n"

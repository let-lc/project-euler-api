  "content": "<p>Let $r_a$, $r_b$ and $r_c$ be the radii of three circles that are mutually and externally tangent to each other. The three circles then form a <dfn>triangle of circular arcs</dfn> between their tangency points as shown for the three blue circles in the picture below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<img src=\"project/images/p727_circular_arcs.jpg\" alt=\"CircularArcs\" /></div>\n\n<p></p>\nDefine the circumcircle of this triangle to be the red circle, with centre $D$, passing through their tangency points. Further define the incircle of this triangle to be the green circle, with centre $E$, that is mutually and externally tangent to all the three blue circles. Let $d=\\vert DE \\vert$ be the distance between the centres of the circumcircle and the incircle.\n<p>\nLet $\\mathbb{E}(d)$ be the expected value of $d$ when $r_a$, $r_b$ and $r_c$ are integers chosen uniformly such that $1\\leq r_a&lt;r_b&lt;r_c \\leq 100$ and $\\text{gcd}(r_a,r_b,r_c)=1$.</p>\n<p>\nFind $\\mathbb{E}(d)$, rounded to eight places after the decimal point.</p>\n"

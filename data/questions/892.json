The $n$ line segments then cut the circle into $n + 1$ pieces.\nEach piece is painted either black or white, so that adjacent pieces are opposite colours.\nLet $d(C)$ be the absolute difference between the numbers of black and white pieces under the cutting $C$.</p>\n\n<p>\nLet $D(n)$ be the sum of $d(C)$ over all different cuttings $C$.\nFor example, there are five different cuttings with $n = 3$.</p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img src=\"resources/images/0892_Zebra.png?1714876283\" alt=\"0892_Zebra.png\"></div>\n\n<p>\nThe upper three cuttings all have $d = 0$ because there are two black and two white pieces; the lower two cuttings both have $d = 2$ because there are three black and one white pieces.\nTherefore $D(3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 2 = 4$. \nYou are also given $D(100) \\equiv 1172122931\\pmod{1234567891}$.</p>\n\n<p>\nFind $\\displaystyle \\sum_{n=1}^{10^7} D(n)$.

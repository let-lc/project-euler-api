  "content": "<p>\nInside a rope of length <var>n</var>, <var>n</var>-1 points are placed with distance 1 from each other and from the endpoints. Among these points, we choose <var>m</var>-1 points at random and cut the rope at these points to create <var>m</var> segments.\n</p>\n<p>\nLet E(<var>n</var>, <var>m</var>) be the expected length of the second-shortest segment.\nFor example, E(3, 2) = 2 and E(8, 3) = 16/7.\nNote that if multiple segments have the same shortest length the length of the second-shortest segment is defined as the same as the shortest length.\n</p>\n<p>\nFind E(10<sup>7</sup>, 100).\nGive your answer rounded to 5 decimal places behind the decimal point.\n</p>\n"

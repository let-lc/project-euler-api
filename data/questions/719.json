  "content": "<p>\nWe define an $S$-number to be a natural number, $n$, that is a perfect square and its square root can be obtained by splitting the decimal representation of $n$ into 2 or more numbers then adding the numbers.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor example, 81 is an $S$-number because $\\sqrt{81} = 8+1$.<br />\n6724 is an $S$-number: $\\sqrt{6724} = 6+72+4$. <br />\n8281 is an $S$-number: $\\sqrt{8281} = 8+2+81 = 82+8+1$.<br />\n9801 is an $S$-number: $\\sqrt{9801}=98+0+1$.\n</p>\n<p>\nFurther we define $T(N)$ to be the sum of all $S$ numbers $n\\le N$. You are given $T(10^4) = 41333$.\n</p>\n<p>\nFind $T(10^{12})$\n</p>\n"

We will assume the following conditions:</p><ul><li>There are three six-sided dice with each side having between 1 and <var>N</var> pips, inclusive.</li>\n<li>Dice with the same set of pips are equal, regardless of which side on the die the pips are located.</li>\n<li>The same pip value may appear on multiple dice; if both players roll the same value neither player wins.</li>\n<li>The sets of dice {A,B,C}, {B,C,A} and {C,A,B} are the same set.</li>\n</ul><p>\nFor <var>N</var> = 7 we find there are 9780 such sets.<br />\nHow many are there for <var>N</var> = 30 ?\n</p>\n"

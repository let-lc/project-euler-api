  "content": "<p>\nA firecracker explodes at a height of 100 m above level ground. It breaks into a large number of very small fragments, which move in every direction; all of them have the same initial velocity of 20 m/s.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe assume that the fragments move without air resistance, in a uniform gravitational field with g=9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>.\n</p>\n<p>\nFind the volume (in m<sup>3</sup>) of the region through which the fragments move before reaching the ground. \nGive your answer rounded to four decimal places.\n</p>\n\n\n\n"

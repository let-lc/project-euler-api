One of the possible chains is shown below:<br />\n2 ↔ 3 ↔ 13 ↔ 113 ↔ 103 ↔ 107 ↔ 127<br />\nHowever, 11 and 103 are not 2's relatives.\n</p>\n<p>\nLet F(N) be the sum of the primes ≤ N which are not 2's relatives.<br />\nWe can verify that F(10<sup>3</sup>) = 431 and F(10<sup>4</sup>) = 78728.\n</p>\n<p>\nFind F(10<sup>7</sup>).\n</p>\n"

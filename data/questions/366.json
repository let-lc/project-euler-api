  "content": "<p>\nTwo players, Anton and Bernhard, are playing the following game.<br />\nThere is one pile of n stones.<br />\nThe first player may remove any positive number of stones, but not the whole pile.<br />\nThereafter, each player may remove at most twice the number of stones his opponent took on the previous move.<br />\nThe player who removes the last stone wins.\n</p>\n<p>\nE.g. n=5<br />\nIf the first player takes anything more than one stone the next player will be able to take all remaining stones.<br />\nIf the first player takes one stone, leaving four, his opponent will take also one stone, leaving three stones.<br />\nThe first player cannot take all three because he may take at most 2x1=2 stones. So let's say he takes also one stone, leaving 2. The second player can take the two remaining stones and wins.<br />\nSo 5 is a losing position for the first player.<br />\nFor some winning positions there is more than one possible move for the first player.<br />\nE.g. when n=17 the first player can remove one or four stones.\n</p>\n<p>\nLet M(n) be the maximum number of stones the first player can take from a winning position <i>at his first turn</i> and M(n)=0 for any other position.\n</p>\n<p>\n<span style=\"font-size:larger;\"><span style=\"font-size:larger;\">∑</span></span> M(n) for n≤100 is 728.\n</p>\n<p>\nFind  <span style=\"font-size:larger;\"><span style=\"font-size:larger;\">∑</span></span> M(n) for n≤10<sup>18</sup>.\nGive your answer modulo 10<sup>8</sup>.\n</p>\n"

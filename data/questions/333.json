  "content": "<p>All positive integers can be partitioned in such a way that each and every term of the partition can be expressed as 2<sup>i</sup>x3<sup>j</sup>, where i,j â‰¥ 0.</p>\n\n<p>Let's consider only such partitions where none of the terms can divide any of the other terms.\n<br />For example, the partition of 17 = 2 + 6 + 9 = (2<sup>1</sup>x3<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>1</sup>x3<sup>1</sup> + 2<sup>0</sup>x3<sup>2</sup>) would not be valid since 2 can divide 6. Neither would the partition 17 = 16 + 1 = (2<sup>4</sup>x3<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>0</sup>x3<sup>0</sup>) since 1 can divide 16. The only valid partition of 17 would be 8 + 9 = (2<sup>3</sup>x3<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>0</sup>x3<sup>2</sup>).</p>\n\n<p>Many integers have more than one valid partition, the first being 11 having the following two partitions.\n<br />11 = 2 + 9 = (2<sup>1</sup>x3<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>0</sup>x3<sup>2</sup>)\n<br />11 = 8 + 3 = (2<sup>3</sup>x3<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>0</sup>x3<sup>1</sup>)</p>\n\n<p>Let's define P(<var>n</var>) as the number of valid partitions of <var>n</var>.

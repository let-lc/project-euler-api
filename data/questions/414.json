The process of sorting and subtracting and repeating this until either 0 or the Kaprekar constant is reached is called the <b>Kaprekar routine</b>.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe can consider the Kaprekar routine for other bases and number of digits.<br /> \nUnfortunately, it is not guaranteed a Kaprekar constant exists in all cases; either the routine can end up in a cycle for some input numbers or the constant the routine arrives at can be different for different input numbers.<br />\nHowever, it can be shown that for 5 digits and a base b = 6t+3≠9, a Kaprekar constant exists.<br />\nE.g. base 15: (10,4,14,9,5)<sub>15</sub><br />\nbase 21: (14,6,20,13,7)<sub>21</sub></p>\n<p>\nDefine <var>C<sub>b</sub></var> to be the Kaprekar constant in base <var>b</var> for 5 digits.\nDefine the function <var>sb(i)</var> to be\n</p><ul><li> 0 if i = <var>C<sub>b</sub></var> or if <var>i</var> written in base <var>b</var> consists of 5 identical digits\n</li><li> the number of iterations it takes the Kaprekar routine in base <var>b</var> to arrive at <var>C<sub>b</sub></var>, otherwise\n</li></ul>\nNote that we can define <var>sb(i)</var> for all integers <var>i</var> &lt; <var>b</var><sup>5</sup>. If <var>i</var> written in base <var>b</var> takes less than 5 digits, the number is padded with leading zero digits until we have 5 digits before applying the Kaprekar routine.\n\n<p>\nDefine <var>S(b)</var> as the sum of <var>sb(i)</var> for 0 &lt; <var>i</var> &lt; <var>b</var><sup>5</sup>.<br />\nE.g. S(15) = 5274369<br /> \nS(111) = 400668930299\n</p>\n<p>\nFind the sum of S(6k+3) for 2 ≤ k ≤ 300.<br />\nGive the last 18 digits as your answer.\n</p>\n\n"
